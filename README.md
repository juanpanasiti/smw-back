## Usage

 Start the API server (if not using Docker) with:

```bash
uvicorn __main__:app --reload
```

 Then, head over to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to explore the auto-generated Swagger UI and test endpoints interactively.

* * *

## API Endpoints

 The API provides endpoints to manage:

* **Expenses:** Create, read, update, and delete expense entries.
* **Users:** Register, login, and manage account settings.
* **Authentication:** Token generation and verification using JWT.

 For a full list of endpoints, refer to the interactive API docs once the server is running.

* * *

## Authentication

 SMW-Back uses JWT for secure authentication.  
 Upon login, users receive a token that must be included in the `Authorization` header for protected routes:

```python
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <your-token-here>'
}
```

 It’s straightforward—if you can handle a token, you can handle this API.
